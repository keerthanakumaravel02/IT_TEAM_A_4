ABSTRACT 

 Traditional learning methods often lack efficiency and interactivity, especially when individuals seek to acquire new skills or knowledge from online video resources. Browsing through numerous videos, managing note-taking, and organizing content for effective learning poses a significant challenge.
  our project aims to address these challenges by providing a user-friendly web application that streamlines skill learning. Leveraging the React framework for the user interface, Python for backend operations, and the YouTube Data API for video retrieval, the platform empowers users to select desired skills and access top-rated tutorial videos.. The integration of Firebase ensures secure data storage, while Python-based machine learning tools aid in content summarization, allowing for an informative and secure learning environment.

  It' technical stack are

1.Front-end: ReactJS,CSS
2.Back-end: python
3.Database: firebase



## Prerequisites :
1.Google API Key: You need a Google API key with access to the YouTube Data API.

2.Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python installed to run the script.
3.Firebase Integration (Optional): If intending to integrate Firebase into the project for data storage, you will need to set up a Firebase project and have appropriate credentials.
## Setup
1.Get Google API Key:
Acquire a Google API key with access to the YouTube Data API.

2.Install Required Libraries:
Install the necessary library using the following command
"pip install google-api-python-client".

3.Set API Key:
Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the script with your actual API key.

4.Firebase Integration:
integrate Firebase for data storage:
Set up a Firebase project and obtain the necessary configuration settings.
Install Firebase SDKs or packages as required by your project.
Integrate Firebase-related code into your project.
## Usage/Examples

```javascript
1.Run the Script:Execute the Python script in your terminal.
2.Input Search Query:Enter the desired search query prompted by the script.
3.View Top-Rated Videos:The script fetches the top-rated videos based on your search query and displays their details such as title, URL, views, likes, comments, and the total count (likes + comments + views).
